# Cursor Performance Fix for Drashyam Project

## Problem Identified
Your Cursor IDE was experiencing timeout issues due to:
1. **Large Git pack files** (100+ MB each) in `.git/objects/`
2. **Angular build cache** (100+ MB) in `Frontend/.angular/`
3. **Large node_modules** with esbuild files (10+ MB each)
4. **No performance optimizations** for large codebases

## Solutions Implemented

### âœ… 1. Git Repository Optimization
- Ran `git gc --aggressive --prune=now` to compress Git objects
- Ran `git repack -a -d --depth=250 --window=250` to optimize pack files
- This reduced Git repository size and improved performance

### âœ… 2. Cursor Workspace Settings
Created `.vscode/settings.json` with optimizations:
- Excluded large directories from file watching
- Disabled unnecessary features for large projects
- Optimized search and indexing

### âœ… 3. Cursor Ignore File
Created `.cursorignore` to exclude:
- Git objects and pack files
- Build artifacts (bin/, obj/, dist/)
- Angular cache (.angular/)
- Node modules and large files
- Specific large files (*.pack, esbuild.*)

### âœ… 4. Angular Cache Cleanup
- Removed `Frontend/.angular/` directory (100+ MB of cache files)
- This will regenerate on next build but improves Cursor performance

## Next Steps

### 1. Restart Cursor IDE
**IMPORTANT**: Close and restart Cursor completely to apply all settings.

### 2. Rebuild Angular Dependencies (if needed)
If you need to rebuild the frontend:
```bash
cd Frontend
npm install
ng build
```

### 3. Test Performance
- Try using Cursor features (autocomplete, search, etc.)
- The timeout issues should be resolved

## Performance Monitoring

### If Issues Persist:
1. Check if `.vscode/settings.json` is being applied
2. Verify `.cursorignore` is working
3. Run `git status` to ensure repository is clean
4. Consider running `git gc` periodically for large repositories

### Additional Optimizations:
- Keep `node_modules` excluded from Cursor indexing
- Use `.gitignore` to prevent large files from being committed
- Regularly clean build artifacts

## Files Created/Modified:
- `.vscode/settings.json` - Cursor workspace settings
- `.cursorignore` - Cursor-specific ignore patterns
- This documentation file

The timeout issues should now be resolved! ðŸš€
